 this github account was originally started while i was taking a bootcamp for ncsu but i am now using github for courses at waketech and this file is for future assignments. 
 i cloned the repository by going to the code tab pressing the down arrow and looking in the local tab we can find where to clone the file. i pressed the copy button and used git clone in my git bash to clone the repository.
